Library currently broken
========================

This library won't compile with recent versions of idris. I have currently 
no motivation to fix this but pull requests are of course welcome and i will 
fix this eventually.

A Monadic Parser written in idris
=================================

This is a library for monadic parser combinators which is basically 
the SimpleParser from idris generalized over more data types than just String.

There is also a HTML parser with Tagsoup-like output which should work 
well enought to be usefull. The aim is to refine the HTML parser until it 
complies to the HTML5 specification.


Comments, bug reports and pull requests are welcome.
